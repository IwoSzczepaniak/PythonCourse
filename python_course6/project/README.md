# This app is a simple Python digital circuit simulator written in Python using the Tkinter library

## The main components of the code are:

- start.py: This script sets up the GUI and handles user interactions. It imports functions and classes from main.py to start the simulation.
- main.py: This script contains the main logic for simulating digital circuits. It defines logical functions and classes for creating LED components and the digital circuit simulator.
- classes.py: This script defines the LED and DigitalCircuitSimulator classes used in the simulation.
- logical_functions.py: This script defines logical functions like NAND, AND, OR, etc., which are used to create the digital circuit

## HOW TO START
- Go to start.py and run your code!
- Interact with the GUI to simulate digital circuits.
- You can choose simulating function by clicking on a 'Different logical function'.
- In some cases you can also set the number of input signals.
- Both the output and input are represented as LEDs.
